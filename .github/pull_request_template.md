## Note

Thanks for your interest in submitting a PR! At this time, because the docs are in beta, the team is currently in the midst of changes and we are not ready for additional contributions yet.

To bring your issue to the team's attention though, we would recommend [creating an issue](https://github.com/vuejs/docs-next/issues/new) and we'll get to it when we can.

Thanks for your understanding!
