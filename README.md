# v3.vuejs.org

This site is built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). Site content is written in Markdown format located in `src`.

## Writing

See the [Vue Docs Writing Guide](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/writing-guide.html) for our rules and recommendations on writing and maintaining documentation.

> At this time, because the docs are in beta, the team is currently in the midst of changes and we are not ready for additional contributions yet. To bring your issue to the team's attention though, we would recommend [creating an issue](https://github.com/vuejs/docs-next/issues/new) and we'll get to it when we can.

## Developing

1. Clone repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vuejs/docs-next.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn # or npm install
```

3. Start local development environment

```bash
yarn serve
```

## Deploying

The site is automatically deployed when commits land in `master`, via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
