# Translations

Vue has spread across the globe, with the core team being in at least half a dozen different timezones. [The forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/) includes 7 languages and counting and many of our docs have [actively-maintained translations](https://github.com/vuejs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vuejs.org). We'are very proud of Vue's international reach, but we can do even better.

## Can we start translating Vue 3 docs?

Yes! We are ready for translation!

## How can I get involved with translations?

The best way to get started is to check out [this pinned issue for Vuejs.org](https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org/issues/2015) that contains active discussions on the various initiatives happening in the community.
