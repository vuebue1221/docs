# Render Functions & JSX

## Basics

Vue recommends using templates to build your HTML in the vast majority of cases. There are situations however, where you really need the full programmatic power of JavaScript. That's where you can use the **render function**, a closer-to-the-compiler alternative to templates.

Let's dive into a simple example where a `render` function would be practical. Say you want to generate anchored headings:

``` html
<h1>
  <a name="hello-world" href="#hello-world">
    Hello world!
  </a>
</h1>
```

For the HTML above, you decide you want this component interface:

``` vue-html
<anchored-heading :level="1">Hello world!</anchored-heading>
```

When you get started with a component that only generates a heading based on the `level` prop, you quickly arrive at this:

``` js
const app = Vue.createApp({})

app.component('anchored-heading', {
  template: `
    <h1 v-if="level === 1">
      <slot></slot>
    </h1>
    <h2 v-else-if="level === 2">
      <slot></slot>
    </h2>
    <h3 v-else-if="level === 3">
      <slot></slot>
    </h3>
    <h4 v-else-if="level === 4">
      <slot></slot>
    </h4>
    <h5 v-else-if="level === 5">
      <slot></slot>
    </h5>
    <h6 v-else-if="level === 6">
      <slot></slot>
    </h6>
  `,
  props: {
    level: {
      type: Number,
      required: true
    }
  }
})
```

That template doesn't feel great. It's not only verbose, but we're duplicating `<slot></slot>` for every heading level and will have to do the same when we add the anchor element.

While templates work great for most components, it's clear that this isn't one of them. So let's try rewriting it with a `render` function:

``` js
const app = Vue.createApp({})

app.component('anchored-heading', {
  render() {
    const { h } = Vue

    return h(
      'h' + this.level,   // tag name
      this.$slots.default() // array of children
    )
  },
  props: {
    level: {
      type: Number,
      required: true
    }
  }
})
```

<!-- TODO: Reword following section because "familiarity with instance properties" is misleading as `setup()` function does not have direct access to instance.  -->
Much simpler! The code is shorter, but also requires greater familiarity with Vue instance properties. In this case, you have to know that when you pass children without a `v-slot` directive into a component, like the `Hello world!` inside of `anchored-heading`, those children are stored on the component instance at `$slots.default`. If you haven't already, **it's recommended to read through the [instance properties API](#TODO-add-link) before diving into render functions.**

## Nodes, Trees, and the Virtual DOM

Before we dive into render functions, itâ€™s important to know a little about how browsers work. Take this HTML for example:

```html
<div>
  <h1>My title</h1>
  Some text content
  <!-- TODO: Add tagline  -->
</div>
```

When a browser reads this code, it builds a [tree of "DOM nodes"](https://javascript.info/dom-nodes) to help it keep track of everything, just as you might build a family tree to keep track of your extended family.

The tree of DOM nodes for the HTML above looks like this:

Every element is a node. Every piece of text is a node. Even comments are nodes! A node is just a piece of the page. And as in a family tree, each node can have children (i.e. each piece can contain other pieces).

Updating all these nodes efficiently can be difficult, but thankfully, you never have to do it manually. Instead, you tell Vue what HTML you want on the page, in a template:

```html
<h1>{{ blogTitle }}</h1>
```

Or a render function:

``` js
render() {
  return Vue.h('h1', this.blogTitle)
}
```

And in both cases, Vue automatically keeps the page updated, even when `blogTitle` changes.

### The Virtual DOM

Vue accomplishes this by building a **virtual DOM** to keep track of the changes it needs to make to the real DOM. Taking a closer look at this line:

``` js
return Vue.h('h1', this.blogTitle)
```

What is `h()` actually returning? It's not _exactly_ a real DOM element. It could perhaps more accurately be named `createNodeDescription`, as it contains information describing to Vue what kind of node it should render on the page, including descriptions of any child nodes. We call this node description a "virtual node", usually abbreviated to **VNode**. "Virtual DOM" is what we call the entire tree of VNodes, built by a tree of Vue components.
